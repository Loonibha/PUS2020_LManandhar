Hi, I am Loonibha. I am a Masters student in Geography starting my second semester this Fall. I have a Bachelors in Environmental Sciences with a focus on hazard mitigation. After graduating, I worked with using GIS and remote sensing for flood hazard studies, analyzing changes in habitats of wildlife including snow leopards and in eco-entrepreneurship circles in Nepal, where I'm from.       
I hope to polish my python coding skills, handle large quantities of data using python, to learn how to better visualize data and to apply all this to better undersatnd urban systems.
